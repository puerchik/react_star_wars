# React Star Wars

React Star Wars is an interactive website that allows users to choose a theme for the site's design, inspired by the Star Wars universe. The project uses React for building the user interface and contexts for managing themes.

## Features

- **Interactive Theme Selection**: Users can easily switch between Light, Dark, and Neutral themes to personalize their browsing experience.
- **Dynamic Logo Change**: The logo in the header dynamically changes based on the selected theme, enhancing the thematic consistency across the site.
- **Error Handling**: The site gracefully handles errors, providing clear messages to users when certain data is unavailable.
- **Favorites Tracking**: A feature that allows users to keep track of their favorite items, with a direct link to view their selections.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Built with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **State Management**: Uses Redux for global state management, ensuring efficient updates and predictable state container.
- **Styling**: Leverages CSS Modules for scoped CSS, allowing for modular and maintainable styles.
- **Context API**: Utilizes React's Context API for theme management, enabling easy theming across the entire app.
- **Dependencies Management**: Managed through npm, the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js.
